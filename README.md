<h2>Software Engineering Group 7</h2>

This repository is for Software Engineering 332:452.

Demo 1 for this project was presented in the EIT Lab in the Engineering Building on April 1, 2014, 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM

This repository contains all the files necessary to run the website.
This code can be hosted locally using a program like XAMPP to host an Apache and MySQL server.
The website is also hosted and can be accessed via http://whiteledge.com which is periodically updated.

Current features that have been <i>implemented</i> in the design include:

-Registration

-Reservation (Creating & Deleting)

-Elevator Simulation

-Parking Simulation

-Ability to extend a reservation (Payment feature for this still needs work)

<b>Features that are currently being developed:</b> (These features are hope to be implemented by early May 2014)

-Improving the payment feature (putting the payment feature on a completely seperate page)

-Implement the functionality of regular and oversized cars

-Addition of a second elevator

-Create a mobile application with capabilities similar to the website

-Work on creating a database with a foreign key along with better database organization

-Graphics

-Making website more user friendly and easier to navigate; reduce the number of clicks necessary to achieve a task

-Developing an admin portal to allow for adminstrators to view all reservations and modify/add reservations
