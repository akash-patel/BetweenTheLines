This repository is for Software Engineering 332:452.

Demo 1 for this project was presented in the EIT Lab in the Engineering Building on April 1, 2014, 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM

This repository contains all the files necessary to run the website.
This code can be hosted locally using a program like XAMPP to host an Apache and MySQL server.
The website is also hosted and can be accessed via http://whiteledge.com which is periodically updated.

<b>Features that are currently being developed:</b> (These features are hope to be implemented by early May 2014)

-Ability to extend a reservation

-Implement the functionality of regular and oversized cars

-Addition of a second elevator

-Create a mobile application with capabilities similar to the website
